            <p>If it is a non PWM auxiliary supply, check at the output pin of the IC.</p>
            <p>What is auxiliary supply? These are non-generic motherboard supplies that are generated for specific
              function in a particular motherboard. There can be more than one auxiliary supply on a motherboard and it
              is either generated with PWM or single I.C e.g APL5930. The most common one is 1.8v</p>
            <p>We can refer to auxiliary voltage as any other supply aside from the following supplies:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Standby supply (3V & 5V)</li>
              <li>RAM supply</li>
              <li>Chipset(ICH/PCH) supply 1.05</li>
              <li>CPU supply</li>
              <li>Graphics supply and</li>
              <li>Battery supply</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On some motherboards, mostly the recent motherboards there use to be more of auxiliary voltages that are
              very important fo motherboard to work. Thes voltages include 1.0v, 1.1v, 1.8v</p>

            <p>Some auxiliary voltage use to be PWM circuit and sometimes just a single IC will be doing the whole task.
              However, for checking any PWM circuit on your motherboard, it is a good practice to always check drain
              voltage of top MOSFET.</p>
            <p>What is the expected voltage? It is always stated clearly in the schematic.</p>
            <p>There can be more than one auxiliary supplies on the motherboard.</p>
            <p>Watch out for those motherboard architectures that there auxiliary voltage will not be generated by a
              PWM, instead it will be generated by just a simple IC like RT9025, APL5930, RT9043GB e.t.c</p>
            <p>The input naming convension can be VIN or VCC (or more).</p>

            <p>Confirm the presence and value of the components surrounding (components connected to the IC) the IC such
              as resistor resistance value and capacitor impedance. One out of the component might have been missing.
            </p>
            <p>Example of these components includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Resistance value of resistor connected to TON pin</li>
              <li>Resistance value of BOOT resistor</li>
              <li>Impedance of BOOT capacitor (It is best practic to test this capacitor outside the motherboard)</li>
              <li>Resistance value of resistors connected to FB pin e.t.c.</li>
              <li>Confirm voltage at drain of PWM top MOSFET</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The feedback(FB) pin is very important, be sure to confirm the presence and resistors value.</p>
