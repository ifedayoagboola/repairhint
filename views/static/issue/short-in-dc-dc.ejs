        <h3>Short in DC-DC output</h3>
        <p>Follow the below steps to clear the short.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Reduce the DC supply voltage to voltage not more than shorted voltage.</li>
          <li>Reduce amps to around 1amps or less.</li>
          <li>Connect negative of DC supply to ground of the motherboard.</li>
          <li>Connect positive of DC supply to shorted line.</li>
          <li>Turn on your DC supply and gentle search for any heating component.</li>
          <li>If you can't find heating component, keep increasing the amps and search for any heating component.</li>
          <li>Do not increase above adapter shorted voltage</li>
        </ol>
        <P>Once you find any heating component, take the component out of the motherboard and check impedance again at
          your testing point.</P>
        <P>If impedance is good after taking out the component, replace it with good one and proceed by testing
          motherboard after replacing faulty component.</P>
        <p>If impedance is still bad, repeat the same process untill the short is clear.</p>

        <p>If problem does not resolve after rectifying this, continue troubleshooting by navigating to the current
          state of your motherboard.</p>
